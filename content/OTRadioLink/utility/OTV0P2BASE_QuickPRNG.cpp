//X ABC Algorithm Random Number Generator for 8-Bit Devices:
//This is a small PRNG, experimentally verified to have at least a 50 million byte period
//by generating 50 million bytes and observing that there were no overlapping sequences and repeats.
//This generator passes serial correlation, entropy , Monte Carlo Pi value, arithmetic mean,
//And many other statistical tests. This generator may have a period of up to 2^32, but this has
//not been verified.
//
// By XORing 3 bytes into the a,b, and c registers, you can add in entropy from 
//an external source easily.
//
//This generator is free to use, but is not suitable for cryptography due to its short period(by
//cryptographic standards) and simple construction. No attempt was made to make this generator 
// suitable for cryptographic use.
//
//Due to the use of a constant counter, the generator should be resistant to latching up.
//A significant performance gain is had in that the x variable is only ever incremented.
//
//Only 4 bytes of ram are needed for the internal state, and generating a byte requires 3 XORs ,
//2 ADDs, one bit shift right , and one increment. Difficult or slow operations like multiply, etc 
//were avoided for maximum speed on ultra low power devices.
